## Description
This app will allow the user to store notes so that they can keep track of their goals and thoughts! They will also be able to delete their notes when they are no longer required.
<br>
Below is a link to my deployed app on Heroku:

## Technology Used
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Heroku (For deployment)
## Installation
The user would need to install Node, the following link describes how to do so: https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs <br> After installing Node they will then have to install the required packages and they can do so by using the command "npm i" in the terminal.
## Usage
To use my application the user will have to open the application in Heroku. Once opened they will press the 'get started' button. They will see a test note which is there for demonstrative purposes. Once they have typed in a note title as well as note text they can click on the save icon (which will be displayed once the required fields are populated) to save the new note. Once saved they can pull up any saved notes by clicking on the note title on the left side panel- please be aware that the title must be clicked and not the area around it. To delete a note the user can click on the delete icon and the note will be deleted. To create a new note the user will click the add icon on the top right and repeat the above process. Thank you for using my app!
